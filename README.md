# Maximum Likelihood Ground Truth based on Uncertainty Areas

## Overview

We propose a novel method to compute a new ground truth, focusing on areas of high uncertainty among experts.
This approach allows us to better understand the individual characteristics, extract their behavior, and use 
this insight to create a more sophisticated ground truth using maximum-likelihood. 
These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion of leveraging machine learning algorithms for medical image 
segmentation, particularly in scenarios involving multiple human annotators.

## Environment Setup

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv maximum_likelihood_gt_env

3. Activate the virtual environment (Unix/Linux):

   ```bash
   source maximum_likelihood_gt_env/bin/activate
   
5. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   
7. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
